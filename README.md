# AI_Traffic_Control_System
This System contains Automated traffic light control program which will control the Traffic lights on the basis of Traffic for particular lanes Dynamically , In Real Time.

We are using TF for detection of vehicles and we are seperating lanes on the basis of Dimensions of lanes of the Road ( will make it dynamic ).
We are using "ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_shared_box_predictor_640x640_coco14_sync_2018_07_03" trained Model by TF.

This System is Unfinished Project. So Feel Free to Cotribute.
